# terminal-http

terminal-http is the backend for my github pages website that has a terminal emulator. When the user runs a program, the inputs are send to this server
ran on a subprocess, then the results of the computation are sent back to the client and finally written back onto the terminal.

The motivation for this project was to show some of my cool command line projects that most people never would have otherwise seen.
